# philips-curves
A quick overview of Phillip Curves across different countries in the last 20 years.
I extracted data from different countries to see if there is still a trade-off between unemployment and inflation, as classical models state. 
We can easily see that this tendency has been broken over the last 20 years, and if there was a negative relation among these two variables, this relationship it does not work nowadays as negative.

I also took the liberty to examine deeper the structure of the unemployment rate based on the education of the human capital of each country. Moreover, a sectorial analysis per country is made, and a little regression model breakdown by the main components of GDP is also made in order to see the main differences and the reasons why the growth GDP rate is higher in some countries.

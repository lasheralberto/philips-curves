# philips-curves
A quick overview of Phillip Curves across different countries in the last 20 years.
I extracted data from different countries to see if there is still a trade-off between unemployment and inflation, as classical models state. 
We can easily see that this tendency has been broken over the last 20 years, and if there was a negative relation among these two variables, this relationship it does not work nowadays as negative.
